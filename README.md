# Ionic-Ecommerce

Ionic-Ecommerce is a project using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) to make a mobile frontend to an ecommerce store.  It can be deployed as a mobile site for an ecommerce store, or built into native iOS and Android apps which will access the products, account, login, logout, cart, and checkout functions of the ecommerce site.
