# Ionic-Ecommerce

Ionic-Ecommerce is a project using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) to make a mobile frontend to an ecommerce store.  It can be deployed as a mobile site for an ecommerce store, or built into native iOS and Android apps which will access the products, account, login, logout, cart, and checkout functions of the ecommerce site.

The backend server is at (http://ionic-ecommerce.herokuapp.com) and its repo is at (https://github.com/cachrisman/ionic-ecommerce-server)
